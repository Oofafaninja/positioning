        <p>Hey anyone reading this my name is Brandon Tran, and here is my website showcasing my Github, LinkedIn, and some of the projects I have built.</p>

        <p>I graduated from Hazen Highschool Renton Washington, in June 2022, and after that I went into a program called Year-Up (YU). And YU is essentially a program that takes young adults and turns them into young professionals in 1 year. 
         Right now I am currently in the first phase of the program called Learning and Development where they teach us hard skills like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and soft skills about how to be a professional in the business world. After learning and Development I hope to get a internship at a good company and hope to get a lot of experience.</p>

        <p>So far there is only 1 project on here and that is my Stylin with CSS project. That project was my very first work that I had done with CSS and HTML.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, I know it doesn't look that much but this is just the start of a great journey. If you wish to follow along with me you can connect with me on LinkedIn at the top of the page.</p>
